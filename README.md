# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
This is an analysis to determine whether there is any bias in results of Amazon reviews based on whether a product was a part of the Vine program.
## Results
* After cleaning the data, there were zero products remaining in the dataset that were reviewed and a part of the Vine program. There were 403,807 products in the dataset that were not a part of the Vine program.
* There were no 5-star reviews for Vine products. There were 242,889 5-star reviews for non-Vine products.
* Since the dataset of Vine products is empty, the percentage of Vine products with a 5-star review is not meaningful. 60.1% of non-Vine product reviews were 5 stars.

## Summary
In summary, it is impossible to determine if there is a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program, since none of the books in the dataset were a part of the program. In order to determine whether the Vine program results in a positivity bias, data in another product category or historical should be reviewwed to see if a bias can be found.
